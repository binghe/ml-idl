IDL Release History
@(#)RELEASE	2.1 93/03/08 00:03:17

Release 1: September 1992
	This release was badly flawed. The example X server was
	abstracted from the real X server used in Jape, then subjected
	to a few ``improvements'' -- many of them were hastily
	implemented and not really tested in as production program.

Release 2: March 7th 1993
	This release fixes the (embarrassingly) foolish mistakes in the
	example X server idlx, and the SimpleCanvas widget. The example
	program (idlx.run.sml) exercises a little more of the
	functionality of the server.
